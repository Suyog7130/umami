Routine to call my waveform models with Bilby
and estimate the posteriors! We will generate some simulated
data and call theoretical waveforms from my trained ML model
and then try to constrain the parameter posteriors!
Then we can work with real events and noise from the detectors,
and do the same for say the GW150914 etc.
